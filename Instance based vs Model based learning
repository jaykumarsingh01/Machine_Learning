# Usual/Conventional Machine Learning 
Prepare the data for model training 
Train model from training data to estimate model parameters i.e. discover patterns 
Store the model in suitable form 
Generalize the rules in form of model, even before scoring instance is seen 
Predict for unseen scoring instance using model 
Can throw away input/training data after model training 
Requires a known model form 
Storing models generally requires less storage 






# Instance Based Learning 
Prepare the data for model training. No difference here 
Do not train model. Pattern discovery postponed until scoring query received 
There is no model to store 
No generalization before scoring. Only generalize for each scoring instance individually as and when seen 
Predict for unseen scoring instance using training data directly 
Input/training data must be kept since each query uses part or full set of training observations 
May not have explicit model form 
Storing training data generally requires more storage
